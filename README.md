A vanilla JavaScript calculator created as part of The Odin Project.

Welcome to Sketchpad, a modern rendition of the classic Etch-a-Sketch game. This project allowed me to explore and strengthen my understanding of key web development concepts.

## Introduction

Sketchpad is more than just a digital drawing board; it's a journey down memory lane, capturing the essence of Etch-a-Sketch with added functionality that enhances the user experience. It's designed for both those who loved the original and newcomers seeking a unique digital drawing experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Size:** Adjust the grid size with a handy slider to fine-tune your drawing canvas.
- **Customizable Colors:** Choose your pen and background colors for a more personalized drawing experience.
- **Undo & Redo Functionality:** Made a mistake? No worries! Use the undo and redo buttons to navigate your drawing history.
- **Responsive Design:** Whether you're on a desktop or mobile, Sketchpad ensures an optimal drawing experience.

## What I Learned

Creating Sketchpad was a tremendous learning experience. Here's a breakdown of my takeaways:

### JavaScript Fundamentals

- **DOM Manipulation:** Gained a deeper understanding of how to dynamically generate, modify, and interact with HTML elements.
- **Event Listeners:** Learned the intricacies of various mouse and keyboard events to make the drawing experience seamless.
- **Array Methods:** Delved into array manipulation methods like .map(), .push(), and .slice() for the undo and redo functionality.

### CSS Magic

- **Grid Layout:** Leveraged the power of CSS grid to create a responsive and adjustable drawing grid.
- **Dynamic Styling:** Used JavaScript in conjunction with CSS to dynamically adjust styles based on user preferences.

### Problem-Solving

- **Designing Undo/Redo:** Conceptualizing and implementing the undo and redo feature was a challenging task that improved my problem-solving skills.
- **Optimization:** Ensured that every feature was optimized for performance to handle dynamic grid sizes and multiple drawing sessions.

## Conclusion

With every line of code and design choice, I discovered the limitless possibilities and challenges that come with developing an interactive application. This project, while reminiscent of a classic toy, encapsulates my growth as a developer and stands as a beacon for future endeavors. To everyone who tries out Sketchpad, I hope you not only enjoy its functionality but also appreciate the passion and effort poured into it.
